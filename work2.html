        <p>Melodies in the Grotto was a melody created as a sound design experimenting with Synths in Rack and Max.</p>

        <h5>Initial Research:</h5>

    <section class="element">
        <p>The initial learning process for this project was relatively difficult. Rack 2 and Max were both programs that I have never previously used before,
            as such, I had to do a lot of digging in order to properly learn how to create sounds with synths in Rack 2 and how to extrapolate those sounds to create
            a collected melody in Max client.</p>

        <h5>Process Analysis:</h5>
    </section>

    <section class="element">
        <p>For the project, my aim was to explore surrealist sounds that surround a cave structure, aiming to create a soundtrack composition of what someone 
            might experience setting foot into a damp, ancient cave full of mysterious fantasy. One of the technical concepts that was explored in the synth composition
            was utilizing "Physical Modelling Synthesis" to create an synth effect that was extremely similar to a droplet of water coming from the ceiling of a cave. 
            Which was a constant sound that was persistent throughout the entire audio soundtrack. 
            The overall mood that was being worked towards was to create an immersive melody that can successfully convey the setting as well as a mysterious mood for the listener.</p>
